### Editing the Project

You can start editing the page by modifying [`pages/index.js`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2Fpages%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pages%2Findex.js%22%5D "/workspaces/finance-manager/pages/index.js"). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Database Integration with Supabase

This project uses Supabase for database integration. The configuration and client setup are handled in [`lib/supabaseClient.js`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2Flib%2FsupabaseClient.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22lib%2FsupabaseClient.js%22%5D "/workspaces/finance-manager/lib/supabaseClient.js").

#### Setting Up Supabase

1. Create a Supabase account and project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Obtain your Supabase URL and API Key from the project settings.

#### Configuring Supabase Client

Create a file named [`lib/supabaseClient.js`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2Flib%2FsupabaseClient.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22lib%2FsupabaseClient.js%22%5D "/workspaces/finance-manager/lib/supabaseClient.js") and add the following code:

```javascript
// lib/supabaseClient.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```

Ensure you have the environment variables set in your [`.env.local`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2F.env.local%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22.env.local%22%5D "/workspaces/finance-manager/.env.local") file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

#### Using Supabase Client in API Routes

You can use the Supabase client in your API routes to interact with the database. For example, in [`pages/api/api.js`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22pages%2Fapi%2Fhello.js%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Ffinance-manager%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A47%2C%22character%22%3A46%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"):

```javascript
// pages/api/api.js
const handleUpdateTransaction = async () => {
  const { id, amount, type, description } = currentTransaction;

  // Update the transaction with the new data and current date
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("transactions")
    .update({
      amount,
      type,
      description,
      created_at: new Date(), // Update the date to current date/time
    })
    .eq("id", id);

  if (error) {
    console.error("Error updating transaction:", error);
  } else {
    setEditMode(false);
    setCurrentTransaction(null);
    fetchTransactions(); // Refresh the transaction list
  }
};
```

### Font Optimization
